Paragraphs Accordion Feature
============================

This is a simple feature which when enabled adds two paragraph bundle types:
Accordion and
Accordion item

The accordion paragraph bundle type has a single paragraph field which references the paragraph items. The paragraph
items bundle type has two fields: Paragraph title and paragraph content (long text). To use this feature simply
enable it and then add a paragraph field to your content type and have it reference the accordion paragraph type.

In this feature there is a theme folder containing a single template which cleans up the markup. Simply place this
inside your theme folder in order to clean up the wrapper divs on each of the accordion items.
